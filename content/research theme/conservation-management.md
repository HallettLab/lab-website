_What goals should we set for conservation efforts in an era of global change? Are there creative, science-based tools to achieving these goals?_

## Setting goals for novel ecoystems

At a national and international level, there is growing debate about what restoration means in a human-dominated age. How do we conceive of nature, how do we value it, and how do we restore it in a world of rapid change? We work with diverse collaborators to address these questions and improve overarching frameworks for ecological management decisions. One aspect of global change is the rise of “novel” ecosystems – ecosystems that arise from human causes (e.g., climate change, species invasion) but are not under human control. An emerging principle is that management in novel ecosystems may be most successful by focusing on ecosystem services or species conservation rather than restoration per se. These collaborations are setting a groundwork to identify when traditional restoration, and when alternative strategies, are optimally applied.

## Grazing effects on Stipa 
Depending on the context, grazing can be both a challenge an aid to species conservation. The East Bay Regional Park District ([EBPRD](https://www.ebparks.org/)) has a long standing interest in maintaining biodiversity on their lands. A focal point for the EBRPD is to maintain populations of purple needgrass (_Stipa pulchra_), a native perennial that is California's state grass. In collaboration with [Loralee Larios](https://llarios12.wixsite.com/lariosecology), we are conducting a demographic study of Stipa in relation to sheep grazing to guide future conservation grazing management.  

## Compost amendments in rangelands
Compost amendments are gaining traction in California as a tool to increase soil carbon sequestration and forage production in rangelands. Experimental studies suggest that a single application of amendments can elevate both services for at least ten years. On the other hand, amendments contain nitrogen, which is associated with loss of species and functional diversity. Functional loss, especially of stress-tolerant species, could affect the resilience of forage to drought. However, much of the nitrogen in compost is in organic form, which is less accessible to plants. In collaboration with [Whendee Siver](https://nature.berkeley.edu/silverlab/) and [Katie Suding](https://www.colorado.edu/sudinglab/), we are testing the effect of compost amendments on the resilience of diversity and ecosystem services in an experiment crossing soil amendments with extreme rainfall treatments.
