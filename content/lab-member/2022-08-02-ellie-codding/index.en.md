### About Ellie
I am a fourth year biology major with a minor in history. I joined the Hallett lab in September of 2021 and have been working with Lina Aoyama on grassland restoration projects since then. My honors thesis project is on understanding the effects of reseeding on native bunchgrass in burned grasslands of the Great Basin.
