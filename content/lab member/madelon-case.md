### Education
2020 Yale University _PhD_ in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology  
2012 Princeton University _AB_ in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology

### Research Interests
I am interested in how plant community and ecosystem dynamics respond to environmental variability, disturbance, and global change, with a particular focus on rangelands and savannas.

### Recent Awards
2021 Highly commended paper for Harper Prize, British Ecological Society  
2020 Prize Teaching Fellowship, Yale University   
2019 Robert P. McIntosh Award, ESA Vegetation Section   
2018 Highly commended paper for Southwood Prize, British Ecological Society   
2016 National Geographic Society Young Explorers Grant    
2016 National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship   
2016 Research-in-Residence, Inter-University Training for Continental-Scale Ecology
