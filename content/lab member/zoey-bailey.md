### Education
2024 B.S. in Environmental Science, Minors in Spanish and Global Studies, University of Oregon (expected) 

### Research Interests
Most broadly, I am interested in how ecosystem dynamics respond to environmental disturbance. More specifically, I am interested in how our understanding of plant and animal response to fire can better inform management efforts in a changing global climate.
