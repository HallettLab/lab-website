### About Daj
I joined the Hallett Lab as a Noyce MASTERIt intern to get experience in scientific research so I can apply it to my goals of becoming a biology teacher. I am currently studying the extent to which filbertworm moths are present in hazelnut orchards versus oak forests. Iâ€™m broadly interested in how species coevolution influences plant community biodiversity.
