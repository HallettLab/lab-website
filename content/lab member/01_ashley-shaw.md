2013 Colorado State University _MS_ in Ecology  
2010 Bellarmine University _BA_ in Biology  

### Research Interests
I am interested in how ecosystems and their functions respond to management under global changes, and in particular, the role that soil and plant communities play in regulating ecosystem resilience. 

### Recent Awards
2020 USDA NIFA Postdoctoral Fellowship  
2018 National Science Foundation Travel Award   
2017 _Antarctic Science_ International Bursary
