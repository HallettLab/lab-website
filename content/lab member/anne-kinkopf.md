### About Anne
This summer I am working on the Northern Great Basin Resilience Project with Dr. Case and have really enjoyed learning about our amazing high desert species and the ecosystem them inhabit. In the fall I am returning to West Virginia University as a senior double majoring in Forest Resource Management and Recreation, Parks & Tourism Resources. In my free time, I use my inspiration of the natural world to create nature watercolor paintings. I have a passion for researching and learning about soil microbes and how they interact with aboveground plant life. I hope that my research this summer and in the future will be a source of contribution to effective management of our private and public lands.
