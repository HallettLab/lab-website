### About Marissa
I am an environmental studies master's student from Keizer, OR. I was raised as a hazelnut farmer and am involved with the lab's many hazelnut-oriented projects. I am currently working on my MS thesis investigating native cover crop communities, how they affect soil moisture retention, and the different ways they impact biodiversity in hazelnut orchards. In my free time I love to hike, mushroom hunt, rockhound, and photograph local flora and fungi.
