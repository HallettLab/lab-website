### About Marissa
I am an environmental studies major with a biology minor from Keizer, OR. My interests include hiking, backpacking,
kayaking, and skiing. I was raised as a hazelnut farmer and am working and helping with many of the lab projects involving hazelnuts. 

I am currently working on my undergraduate research thesis looking at different types of hazelnut orchard floor management processes across differing ages of orchards and how evapotranspiration rates affect soil moisture retention. I am also working on a agroecology project looking to reintroduce native forbes as an understory community inside of these varying ages of hazelnut orchards to see which forbes can survive best in competition for sunlight, and in relation to the farming practices used on the orchard floors.
