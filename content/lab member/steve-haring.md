### Education
2022 UC Davis _PhD_ in Horticulture and Agronomy  
2017 Virginia Tech _MS_ in Weed Science  
2014 University of Minnesota _BS_ in Applied Plant Science  

### Research Topics
I am an agroecologist and weed scientist who is interested in weed dispersal, coexistence, agrobiodiversity, and the ecological principles of integrated pest management. I use cover crops as a tool for understanding complex plant interactions within cropping systems, and I currently work in Oregon hazelnut systems. I am also interested in the political ecology of agricultural science, pesticides, and land management decision-making.
