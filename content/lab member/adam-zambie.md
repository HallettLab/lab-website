### About Adam
I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in May of 2021 where I pursued a diverse set of interests in the field of ecology including being a researcher in a fish physiology lab at the University’s Marine Science Institute, conducting an independent research project on fern community ecology, working as a technician on a study of bird hybridization in Central Texas, and writing a senior thesis on species distribution modeling for a non-native fish in Central Texas rivers. Post-graduation I’m currently thrilled to be a field technician in the Hallett Lab working on the Northern Great Basin Resilience Project led by Maddy. I plan to spend a few years working and gaining experience in jobs related to the field of ecology before pursuing a graduate degree in line with my research interests of exploring the physiological and ecological effects of climate change on plants and animals.
