### About Anna
I am a current junior at University in Oregon interested in exploring plant-insect interactions. Currently, I’m studying relationships between microarthropods and invertebrates relative to the plants that coinhabit the soil with them. I hope to explore data analysis, invertebrate extraction techniques, and effective ways to present data through this project with the Hallett Lab. I have a passion for insects and invertebrates and their connections with the environment around them, and I look forward to researching more of these dynamic interactions.
