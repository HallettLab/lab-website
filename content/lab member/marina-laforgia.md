### Research Interests
I am plant population and community ecologist broadly interested in how functional traits predict plant responses to interacting global change factors. For my post-doc I am exploring seed trait trade-offs in arid and semi-arid annuals and whether these traits can improve our understanding of dispersal and persistence mechanisms. This research integrates seed collections, demography, long-term datasets, and novel modeling techniques.
