### Employment
2023 Tulane University, Farrer Lab, _Postdoctoral Research Fellow_  
2021 Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Vegetation Ecology Lab, _Postdoctoral Researcher_

### Education
2021 Utah State University, Kulmatiski Lab, _PhD_ in Ecology  
2013 University of California, Berkeley _BS_ in Molecular Environmental Biology  

### Research Interests
I am interested in how interactions between plants and soil biota influence plant community dynamics. I believe global climate change and biodiversity loss are two of the most pressing ecological issues facing humanity. Consequently one of my main research interests is determining how these changes will affect plant community dynamics via plant-soil feedbacks.

### About Leslie
I am a postdoctoral researcher with Emily Farrer at Tulane University, and you might see me from time to time in the Hallett lab because Lauren is a co-PI on my project. I love plant-soil feedbacks, skiing, knitting, and hanging out with my cat.
