### About Sofi
I’m currently in my second year of undergrad at the University of Oregon where I am working towards majoring in both Marine Biology and Environmental Studies. I am interested in community ecology and ecosystem dynamics, especially species’ reactions to varying environmental conditions. I plan to further develop these interests and pair them with my passion for marine conservation throughout my time at the UO. After graduation, I plan to go to graduate school and make a career advocating for both the terrestrial and marine ecosystems of our planet.
