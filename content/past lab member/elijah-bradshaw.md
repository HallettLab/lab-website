### About Elijah
I am currently a senior at North Carolina State University studying environmental sciences with a concentration in wildlife science. My current research is concerned with the ecology of mixed pine forests, specifically dealing with the relationships between songbirds and shortleaf pine. After completing my undergraduate program I plan to continue to exploring my interests in the connections between wildlife and different plant communities in graduate school.
