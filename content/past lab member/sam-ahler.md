### About Sam
I recently completed my undergraduate degree at UW-Madison where I worked with Dr. Ellen Damschen on a project addressing long-term functional change in Wisconsin savanna understories. I will begin my PhD with Dr. Katie Suding at CU-Boulder this fall, studying how microsite conditions affect seed/seedling success and the implications on ecosystem services. On top of that, I want to understand how belowground interactions impact early community assembly in restorations. I am interested in restoration, functional traits, and belowground ecology.
