### About Chloe
I’ve been working with Dr. Maddy Case, exploring vegetation patterns around cattle watering holes via satellite imaging. As a future educator, I’m interested in interdisciplinary aspects of mathematics and finding inspiration for students in many fields, including ecology and coding.
