### Education
2022 B.S. in Environmental Science, Minors in Biology and Public Policy, Planning, and Management, University of Oregon

### Research Interests
Much of my research has concentrated on the restoration of California grasslands, with emphasis on the impact of non-native species. I want to continue to understand how climate change will impact our ecosystems, and I plan to learn more about sustainable development during my Masterâ€™s program at UC Davis.
