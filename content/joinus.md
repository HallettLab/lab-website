## Opportunities for undergraduates
We are always excited to welcome undergraduates to the lab! We tend to have undergrads start working with us at the beginning of each quarter, and will post opportunities here for any specific opportunities for undergrad assistants on lab projects. Currently Jazz Dhillon is coordinating incoming undergrads. If you are interested in joining the lab please contact her (jdhillon@uoregon.edu) with a brief description of your research interests. Check out our "people" and "research" pages to get a sense of ongoing projects and what current undergrads are doing.

Opportunities range from participating in others' research to gain experience, to eventually conducting your own independent project. We especially encourage getting involved in the lab early in your college career! We supervise a couple of senior theses each year, and prioritize students who have previously worked with us. Past undergrads have been very successful in winning funding for independent research such as UROP grants.


## Opportunities for graduate students
The Hallett lab admits PhD students through the ENVS and Biology programs. If you are interested in joining the lab as a graduate student, contact Lauren with a description of your interests, a CV, and a writing sample if possible. Please also mention if you are interested in interacting about applying for external fellowships such as the NSF GRFP. The best time to reach out is August/September of a given year, in advance of the application deadline. 


## Opportunities for postdocs
If you are a prospective postdoc and are interested in the lab's work, please reach out to Lauren to discuss your interests and opportunities for applicable fellowships and grants.
When there are postdoc opportunities available on existing grants, they will be posted here.
