## Postdoc position open in the lab! 
The Hallett Lab at the University of Oregon is seeking applicants for a two-year, USDA-funded postdoc position in diversified agroecology. The project is a close collaboration with the Ponisio and Silva labs at UO, and we are particularly excited about applicants whose interests lie along the interface of soil-plant-pollinator interactions as well as applicants interested in community-engaged science. The project centers on hazelnut orchards and tests the potential for cover crops to provide ecological co-benefits as well as the potential of grazing to reduce pest pressure. There is opportunity to extend the work based on postdoc interest, with potential directions including plant community restoration, pollinator community assembly and movement patterns, integrative pest management, and/or soil health. 

The position can begin as soon at Jan 2022 but the start date is flexible. The initial appointment is one year, with potential to extend for a second year. The postdoc will be encouraged to take advantage of opportunities to interact across disciplines (both between our labs and within the Institute of Ecology and Evolution, the Data Science Initiative, and the Environmental Studies Program at UO) and professional development opportunities, which could include training in data science as well as the development of new proposals.

Research themes of interest: 
- Below to above ground interactions (soil-plants-pollinators)  
- Prairie and oak woodland restoration  
- Corridor design (for pollinators and plants)  
- Integrative pest management   
- Carbon sequestration  
- Translational ecology and community-engaged research  

Responsibilities  
The candidate will:
- Design and conduct research related to one or more of the above themes   
-	Oversee the management of a multi-person field crew and assist in the mentorship of graduate and undergraduate students  
- Engage with stakeholders throughout the research process   
-	Lead project data management and analysis  
-	Communicate findings to both scientific and agricultural communities  
- Be a leader in the laboratory and help to foster an atmosphere of inclusivity, exploration, learning, and constructive feedback  

Required Qualifications
- Ph.D. in ecology or a related field of study  
- Strong record of leading first-author publications  
-	Experience with quantitative methods in ecology/evolutionary biology  
-	Commitment to fostering inclusivity and diversity in the sciences  
-	Prior experience supervising undergraduate and/or graduate students  
-	Experience in one or more scripting languages such as R or Python  

Preferred Qualifications:
-	Experience in grower-related extension  
-	Experience working with pollinators, plant restoration and/or soil health

## Opportunities for undergraduates
We are always excited to welcome undergraduates to the lab! We tend to have undergrads start working with us at the beginning of each quarter, and will post opportunities here for any specific opportunities for undergrad assistants on lab projects. If you are interested in working with us, contact Lauren (hallett@uoregon.edu) with a brief description of your research interests. Check out our "people" and "research" pages to get a sense of ongoing projects and what current undergrads are doing.

Opportunities range from participating in others' research to gain experience, to eventually conducting your own independent project. We especially encourage getting involved in the lab early in your college career! We supervise a couple of senior theses each year, and prioritize students who have previously worked with us. Past undergrads have been very successful in winning funding for independent research such as UROP grants.


## Opportunities for graduate students
The Hallett lab admits PhD students through the ENVS and Biology programs. If you are interested in joining the lab as a graduate student, contact Lauren with a description of your interests and a CV. Please also mention if you are interested in interacting about applying for external fellowships such as the NSF GRFP. The best time to reach out is August/September of a given year, in advance of the application deadline. 


## Opportunities for postdocs
If you are a prospective postdoc and are interested in the lab's work, please reach out to Lauren to discuss your interests and opportunities for applicable fellowships and grants.
When there are postdoc opportunities available on existing grants, they will be posted here.
