## NOW HIRING - Postdoc in community ecology

The Hallett Lab in the Biology Department and Environmental Studies Program at the University of Oregon is seeking applications for a two-year postdoctoral position in community ecology. Our lab broadly focuses on empirically testing ecological theory with an eye toward ecosystem restoration and management. The position will be part of an NSF-funded project investigating the role of climate variability, nutrient enrichment, and grazing on plant species coexistence. The start date is flexible, though preference will be given to candidates available to start in fall 2023.

The postdoc will empirically test how resource availability and variability shapes the mechanisms that maintain species coexistence, and how this is moderated by grazing. This project will leverage large-scale, existing experimental infrastructure and utilize on-site labor support at the Sierra Foothills Research and Extension Center in Browns Valley, CA. There is opportunity for the postdoc to develop this and other projects using multiple potential methods, such as model development, field experiments, and analysis of pre-existing datasets, depending on their interest and areas of expertise. The position allows for multiple professional development opportunities, such as contributing to data synthesis collaborations, guest teaching in Environmental Data Science and Environmental Studies, and mentoring undergraduate and graduate students.  

Our lab is dedicated to creating an inclusive and equitable environment where all members feel physically and emotionally safe and supported. The successful candidate will be expected to contribute to a collaborative, mutually supportive working environment. 

To apply, please submit a cover letter, CV, links to 1-2 first-authored publications, and the names and contact information for three professional references to hallett.lab@gmail.com. 

Applicants will be accepted through June 26. The position is funded for at least two years. It provides a competitive benefits package, including high-quality health insurance, contributions to a retirement account, and an annual salary based on experience, but starting at $54,840.

If you have questions about the position, please send an email to hallett@uoregon.edu

ESSENTIAL DUTIES 
-	Oversee a large-scale field experiment assessing species coexistence in relation to rainfall variability, nutrient enrichment, and grazing. This includes helping to craft the overall design and leading data collection, analysis, and writing.  
-	Participate in collaborative manuscripts, such as through the Nutrient Network and synthesis collaborations within Institute of Ecology and Evolution at UO.   
-	Provide mentorship for graduate students exploring multi-species coexistence in relation to variable resource and pollinator availability.   
-	Present results through peer-reviewed publication and presentations as conferences.  


QUALIFICATIONS
-	A PhD in ecology, environmental science, mathematics, or a related field by their start date.   
-	A demonstrated interest and ability in working both independently and collaboratively.   
-	Evidence of strong written and oral communication skills, such as through conference presentations and submissions of previous work to peer-reviewed journals.   
-	A commitment to fostering inclusivity and diversity in the science.  
-	A background in ecological theory is preferred, as is experience in one or more scripting languages, especially R.   

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
The Hallett Lab is situated with the Institute of Ecology and Evolution, the Biology Department, and the Environmental Studies Program at the University of Oregon. There are strong research programs and collaborations across these affiliations. The university is located in Eugene, OR, which is a bike-friendly town, with many natural areas within and around town, and access to the coast and the mountains within an hour drive. The campus is within walking distance of the downtown, the Willamette River, and Alton Baker Park.

## Opportunities for undergraduates
We are always excited to welcome undergraduates to the lab! We tend to have undergrads start working with us at the beginning of each quarter, and will post opportunities here for any specific opportunities for undergrad assistants on lab projects. Currently Jazz Dhillon is coordinating incoming undergrads. If you are interested in joining the lab please contact her (jdhillon@uoregon.edu) with a brief description of your research interests. Check out our "people" and "research" pages to get a sense of ongoing projects and what current undergrads are doing.

Opportunities range from participating in others' research to gain experience, to eventually conducting your own independent project. We especially encourage getting involved in the lab early in your college career! We supervise a couple of senior theses each year, and prioritize students who have previously worked with us. Past undergrads have been very successful in winning funding for independent research such as UROP grants.


## Opportunities for graduate students
The Hallett lab admits PhD students through the ENVS and Biology programs. If you are interested in joining the lab as a graduate student, contact Lauren with a description of your interests, a CV, and a writing sample if possible. Please also mention if you are interested in interacting about applying for external fellowships such as the NSF GRFP. The best time to reach out is August/September of a given year, in advance of the application deadline. 


## Opportunities for postdocs
If you are a prospective postdoc and are interested in the lab's work, please reach out to Lauren to discuss your interests and opportunities for applicable fellowships and grants.
When there are postdoc opportunities available on existing grants, they will be posted here.
