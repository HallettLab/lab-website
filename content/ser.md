##  Hands-on restoration experiences for students 
Welcome! We are a collective of undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Oregon with a common interest in ecological restoration. Our mission is to engage in hands-on restoration experiences while building relationships with and learning from local practitioners. We embrace community-centered work, collaborative and translational applied research, and interaction with the larger ecological restoration community. Sign up to our [listserv](https://lists.uoregon.edu/mailman/listinfo/ser
) for event updates and check out our [website](https://blogs.uoregon.edu/uoser/) with more information. Feel free to e-mail us at [uoregon.ser@gmail.com](uoregon.ser@gmail.com) to see what we are up to and how to get involved.
