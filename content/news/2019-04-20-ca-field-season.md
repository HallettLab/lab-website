#### April 2019
We had a great California field season this year. We convinced Richard to return for is 37th (!) year, and then celebrated by exploring the superbloom at Carrizo National Monument. Elizabeth and Eliza got to see first-hand the ant mounds underlying shifts in C:N tissue ratios they have been observing in the lab. Ashley was initiated into Loralee Larios and Lauren's long-term study of grazing on *Stipa pulchra* at Vasco Cave, and then went off to SFREC to measured the marked effect her compost amendment and rainfall manipulation treatments had on productivity, phenology, and composition.
