#### April 2022

It's been a busy year for Carmen, and she is rocking it! She passed her qualifying exam after an excellent talk, was awarded the NSF GRFP, had her first paper accepted at *Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution* (keep an eye out for it - she tackled how herbivory and drought moderate stability in collaboration with the Kenya Long-Term Exclosure experiment), and is off to a great start with a mega field season. Congrats Carmen!
