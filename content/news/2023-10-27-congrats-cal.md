Congratulations to Cal on receiving his MS! Cal has been a fixture in the Hallett Lab since 2018 and has worn many hats - undergraduate researcher, lab manager, two time member of the Great Basin field crew, and most recently, Masters student! Cal has a passion for bridging the gap between conservation and agricultural production that has shaped research directions in the Hallett Lab. He began his research as an undergraduate studying the role of hog grazing in hazelnut orchards as a method of filbertworm pest suppression. His MS research took a new direction in hazelnut orchards to explore bird communities and the way that orchard management practices impact bird conservation. Overall, Cal is best known for his kindness, enthusiasm for science, curiosity about all aspects of an ecosystem, and for baking a mean chocolate chip cookie! He will be joining the USDA NCRS as a Natural Resource Manager!
