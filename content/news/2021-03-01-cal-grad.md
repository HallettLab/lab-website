A big congratulations to Calvin Penkauskas for graduating this term with a dual B.S. in Biology and Environmental Science and for his [amazing work](https://around.uoregon.edu/content/biology-major-recruits-hogs-help-hazelnuts) with hazelnuts and hogs! Lucky for us he will be starting his M.S. in Biology with the lab come fall. Weâ€™re so excited for his future work!
