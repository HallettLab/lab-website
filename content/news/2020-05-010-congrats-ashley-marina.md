A big congratulations to **Ashley** and incoming postdoc **Marina LaForgia**-- both received USDA NIFA Postdoctoral Fellowships, and Marina also received a NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship! 

The lab is going belowground - Ashley will be exploring soil biotic communities and Marina will be studying soil seedbanks. Marina will be co-advised with [Jennifer Gremer](https://gremerlab.wordpress.com/). Excited to start these new projects and collaborations!
