We are wrapping up a marathon field season at the Sierra Foothills Research and Extension Center in Northern California! Hallett lab members Carmen and Marina put in a 'mega-competition' experiment studying how species coexistence and interactions change with severe drought in California grasslands. Using a mix of common native and invasive grassland species we will model interactions between species to understand changes that CA grasslands will experience under climate change as well as management implications for common invasive species. Chhaya set up a related experiment using the same drought infrastructure to extend coexistence theory models to native perennial grasses. We want to send a HUGE thank you to our technicians - Jasmin Albert, Ari Brown, Eda Ceviker, Jazz Dhillon, Anjum Gujral, Natalie Kataoka, and Matthew Willson - for the many dedicated hours in the field. Now, onto sample processing and data analysis!
