Laura had a successful freshwater mussel sampling campaign this summer. Field helpers Kennedy, April Dawne, Jemina and Emily worked with Laura to re-sample known mussel beds throughout the South Umqua. Some beds were mussels all the way down, others were almost entirely gone. Laura will be relating mussel population size and age structure with environmental drivers such as flow rates, land development and sedimentation.
