Congratulations to the newly minted Dr. Brambila! The first PhD student to graduate from the lab, Alejandro rocked it both in his own work and supporting others. In his 5 years here, Alejandro was awarded the NSF GRFP, co-wrote a $500K USDA NIFA, published 5 papers (3 as lead, 1 led by his undergrad mentee) with several more in the pipeline, initiated the lab's hazelnut research program and mentored 4 cohorts of undergraduates through the program. He's now the Agroecologist for the Trustees Institute, where he's enhancing both conservation and agricultural science and outcomes in New England. Congratulations Dr. Alejandro Brambila!
