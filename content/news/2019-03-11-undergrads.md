The undergrads are crushing it! First, big congratulations to **Drew Donahue**, who defended a truly excellent senior thesis. Drew explored whether a pig grazing strategy for pest management would have unintentionally harmful consequences in oak woodlands. She worked hard sampling at My Brother's Farm all summer, and so far the answer is no - limited, late-season grazing seems to be okay.

Plus **Cal Penkauskas** and **Elizabeth Baach** both were awarded UROP mini-grants!
