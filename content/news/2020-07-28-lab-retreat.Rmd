#### July 28-29, 2020
We had a summer lab retreat on July 28-29. We workshopped our papers over zoom in the mornings - those were very productive mornings! We then wrapped up our retreat kayaking in Fern Ridge Reservior. We enjoyed each other's company (6-feet apart, of course) and the warm sun. Laura helped us identify some bird species, too.
