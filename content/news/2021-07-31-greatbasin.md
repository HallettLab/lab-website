The Great Basin field crew wrapped up a massive field season across Oregon and Idaho! Led by postdoc Maddy Case, the crew sampled a total of 267 vegetation plots in burned and unburned grazing allotments to examine how vegetation structure and annual grass invasion respond to different combinations of grazing, fire history, and environmental context across the Northern Great Basin. Field technicians Sam Ahler, Elijah Bradshaw, Anne Kinkopf, Cal Penkauskas, and Adam Zambie made for an intrepid team in all conditions - from snow to scorching heat to wildfire smoke - and were still smiling at the end of it!
