Another paper roundup! **Alejandro** had his first Hallett Lab paper published in the Journal of Vegetation Science, looking at the effect of grazing, spatial heterogeneity and climate on beta-diversity at the Carrizo Plain. Check it here: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jvs.12862?af=R

Our R package **[codyn](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/codyn/index.html)** just received a big update with help from Meghan Avolio. New features make it easier to analyze patterns of community variation over space and time (helpful for Alejandro's paper, for example!). Check out associated manuscript here (open access): https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.2881   

And **Lauren** was part of big synthesis of [CORRE](https://corredata.weebly.com/) data led by Kim Komatsu in PNAS: https://www.pnas.org/content/116/36/17867
