#### August 2018
It's been a great summer at My Brother's Farm. Alejandro, Cal, Drew, Naomi, Julia and Taylor sampled filbert worms both as they emerged from the ground and flew in the canopy. The pigs are currently being deployed to test whether pig grazing in the oak woodlands can reduce filbert worm pest pressure on Taylor's hazelnut stands.
