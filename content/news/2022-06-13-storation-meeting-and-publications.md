#### June 2022
The sToration working group on species coexistence and restoration had our second  meeting in Leipzig, Germany this June. We were so excited that we finally got to see each other in-person for the first time in two years.

Chhaya Werner led a novel methods paper that applies Bayesian sparse modelling approach to a diverse plant communities and distangles the role of environment and species interactions effects. The paper - "Distangling key species interactions in diverse and heterogeneous communities: A Bayesian sparse modelling approach" can be read here (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ele.13977).

Lina Aoyama led an empirical paper on applying species coexistence theory to vernal pool restoration to diagnose why restoration failed or succeeded, and what management action would improve the outcome. The paper - "Application of modern coexistence theory to rare plant restoration provides early indication of restoration trajectories" can be read here (https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/eap.2649).
