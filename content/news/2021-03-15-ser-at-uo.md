Over the last few months, members of the Hallett Lab have been meeting to establish a new student chapter of the Society for Ecological Restoration at the University of Oregon. We are excited to announce that we have been offically recognized by SER and the University as a new student group.  Our faculty sponsor is Dr. Hallett, but undergraduate and graduate students interested in restoration across the university are welcome to join.  

We are currently planning an online spring speaker series on sourcing native seeds for restoration. In the future we hope to serve as a point of connection between students at the unviersity and local restoration practitioners.  We look forward to the day we can tour native plant nurseries, see local restoration projects, or even get involved in a project ourselves.
