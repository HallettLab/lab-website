A big welcome to the new Hallett Lab members! 

**Steve Haring** joined us this spring as a postdoc on the hazelnut project. Steve completed his PhD at UC Davis, with a focus on cover crops in almond orchards. We are excited for his expert insights.  

**Marissa Lane-Massee** accepted an MS position with the lab for fall 2023, after continuing with the lab as an NSF post-bac scholar this past year. This year she's implemented an extensive test of native species suitability as cover crops in hazelnut orchards, and we're excited for her future directions.  

**Jasmin Albert** will join the lab as a PhD this fall. Jasmin has a strong background in network analysis and coexistence theory, and has worked with the lab on the "mega-comp" experiment this summer. We look forward to developing projects that bridge empirical and theoretical ecology.

**Jazz Dhillon** will be staying on with the lab as our lab manager after the "mega-comp" field season, with a focus on our plant-soil feedback experiments. We are excited to have her join us up in Eugene.
