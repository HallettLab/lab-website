Andrew completed his PhD with Liza Comita at Yale University. In his postdoc he will be studying mechanisms of coexistence and plant community stability, while also working with the UO Data Science Initiative to develop new undergraduate curricula. Welcome Andrew!  

Carmen joins us from the University of Minnesota where she researched plant communities at the Cedar Creek Long Term Ecological Research site. Welcome Carmen!
