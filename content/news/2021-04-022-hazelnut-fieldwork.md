#### Hazelnut orchard fieldwork begins

Monthly sampling work begins to monitor native forb cover crops seeded in Fall 2019. These study sites are in hazelnut orchards managed by Marissa, a recent Hallett Lab graduate, and her family. This year, we will be evaluating the re-seeding and re-sprouting ability of these plants after they were flailed and the soil was scraped during mechanical treatments. Soil moisture measurements were taken this month, and flowers are starting to bloom already. We have also started monitoring phenology and examining pollinator diversity and visitation in the orchards. Hereâ€™s to a productive field season!
