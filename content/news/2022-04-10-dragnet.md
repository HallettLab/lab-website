New DragNet site established
The Hallett lab is involved in a new and growing globally distributed experiment testing the role of disturbance in species diversity and composition in grasslands. Chhaya and Lauren led the establishment of a DragNet site at Sierra Foothill Research and Extension center with the help of the amazing field crew there.
