#### July 2020

Alejandro, Lina, Paul, Eliza, Cal, and Lauren headed out to Bunchgrass and Lookout Nut Net sites at the HJ Andrews Experimental Forest in Blue River, OR. Thankfully we received university approval during the pandemic to take species composition data and clip biomass from long-term experimental plots treated with factorial additions of nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium - all while maintaining social distancing!
